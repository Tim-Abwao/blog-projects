This is where the code for the projects from my [blog][1] lives.

For anyone interested in trying them out.

## Getting Started

1. Download the files:

    git clone https://github.com/Tim-Abwao/blog-projects.git
    cd blog-projects
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

   For Linux/MacOS:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -U pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
